Training a perceptron model using scikit-learn

We'll be training a perceptron model on Iris dataset. Since, it's simple yet famous dataset that is often used for testing and experimenting with algoirthms, we'll only use two features from the Iris dataset for visualization purposes.

If you have any suggestion or want to contribute, feel free to comment. 
Thank you!
