Training a perceptron model using scikit-learn

It's about how to train a perceptron model on Iris dataset. Since, it's simple yet famous dataset often used for testing and experimenting with algoirthms, I intend to use only two features from the Iris dataset for visualization purposes.

If you have any suggestion or want to contribute, feel free to comment. 
Thank you!
